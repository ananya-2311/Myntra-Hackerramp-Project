# Solutions implemented in the implementation phase: 
## 1)Chat Feature -
Discuss with friends and family members and make right choices.
## 2)Video Calling Feature - 
Video call your friends and family members, share gossip and have fun shopping cool stuff together.
## 3)Image Sharing Feature with Chat -
Click pictures in your favourite outfit and send it to your friend or send a picture from your phone gallery and ask them for opinions. You can do that all and even more with the image sharing feature.
## 4)Link Sharing of Products -
With this feature you can share products links with your friends and family members to prevent the hassle of finding products on the app. This feature currently isn't in complete working condition. We have created the product link and have made the complete UI for its sharing also. Backend integration for this part is left.
                               
# What have we made?

Part 1:
We have made an e-commerce app with fully working cart with complete backend integration (using Realtime Database) wherein user can add and remove items from cart. We have added few products for testing purpose of cart and have created their respective product links also.
Successful Login/SignUp Authentication has also been done using Cloud Firestore.

Part 2:
A complete video calling and messaging feature is also implemented separately which can be integrated with the e-commerce app. 
1) In this part, we can search for users logged in to the app and chat and video call with them.
2) Currently chatroom and video call is supported only between 2 users but we plan to increase that in future and enable group chatrooms and group video calling feature.
3) Image Sharing from gallery as well via camera is enabled. (Firebase Storage used for backend integration)
4) Offline/Online status of users can also be viewed.
   
#### The code for the above mentioned two parts is available in 2 separate branches of this repository
   
# Future Goals

1) We aim to integrate these two parts together.
2) We aim to complete the link sharing functionality completely.
3) Flutter doesnot support screen sharing. We aim to find out a way to integrate that feature to make the app more user-friendly.
4) We also aim to come up with a cart sharing feature in future where two people are able to share their cart contents.
